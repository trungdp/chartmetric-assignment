# Coding Exercise: JS Data Transformation

## Overview

Below, we have a sample API response of tracks played on different days across various radio stations. Each track object represents a single play of that track.

We want to graph the playcounts for each day in a vertical bar chart, where the x-axis represents the day, and the y-axis represents the cumulative radio plays of all tracks for that day. Further, when a user hovers over one of the bars, we want to display a tooltip that lists the different tracks that were played on that day across all radio stations, and the playcounts for each track.

## Sample API Response

```jsx
const response = [
  {
    id: 1293487,
    name: "KCRW",  // radio station callsign
    tracks: [{ timestp: "2021-04-08", trackName: "Peaches" }]
  },
  {
    id: 12923,
    name: "KQED",
    tracks: [
      { timestp: "2021-04-09", trackName: "Savage" },
      { timestp: "2021-04-09", trackName: "Savage (feat. Beyonce)" },
      { timestp: "2021-04-08", trackName: "Savage" },
      { timestp: "2021-04-08", trackName: "Savage" },
      { timestp: "2021-04-08", trackName: "Savage" }
    ]
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    name: "WNYC",
    tracks: [
      { timestp: "2021-04-09", trackName: "Captain Hook" },
      { timestp: "2021-04-08", trackName: "Captain Hook" },
      { timestp: "2021-04-07", trackName: "Captain Hook" }
    ]
  }
];
```

## Desired Data Format

To pass this information into our charting library, we will need to reformat the data returned by our API response into a format our charting library can use.

The structure we are looking for is an array of objects, where each object has three properties:

```jsx
const data = [
 {
   x: day,           // day
   y: total_spins,   // total spins for all tracks on this day
   tooltip: formatted_tooltip
     // tooltip is a string value with the list of track names that 
     // were played that day followed with the number of times that 
		 // track was played in parenthensis, with different tracks
     // separated by commas
 },
 ...
];
```

**Expected output:**

```jsx
const data = [
 {
   x: '2021-04-07', 
   y: 1, 
   tooltip: 'Captain Hook (1)' 
 },
 { 
   x: '2021-04-08',
   y: 5,
   tooltip: 'Peaches (1), Savage (3), Captain Hook (1)'
 },
 {
   x: '2021-04-09',
   y: 3,
   tooltip: 'Savage (1), Savage (feat. Beyonce) (1), Captain Hook (1)'
 }
];
```

## Deliverables

- Vanilla JavaScript or Typescript code that will take the sample API response and transform it into the expected output as described above (no third-party libraries â€” we want to see your original code and the solution you come up with from scratch).
- There is no need to graph the output, we just want to see the expected output via `console.log()`
- Bonus points for clarity and elegance of your code and solution (when it makes sense, we like to see solutions that break the problem down into smaller pieces)
